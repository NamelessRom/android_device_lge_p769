# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for p769 hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and p769, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base_telephony.mk)
# Inherit from u2-common device
$(call inherit-product, device/lge/p769/device.mk)
# Inherit from u2-vendor device
$(call inherit-product, vendor/lge/u2/p769-vendor-blobs.mk)

# Set those variables here to overwrite the inherited values.
PRODUCT_NAME := full_p769
PRODUCT_DEVICE := p769
